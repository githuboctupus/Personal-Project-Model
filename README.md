## Hello!
The Documentation_Model.pdf contains the documentation of my work and journey on this personal project. It contains how I got into it, everything I've learned along the way, and future possible work.

The Version_History.md contains a Markdown File talking about the various of the model. It would be recommended to read the documentation first to learn the context/background knowledge.

I also have included a Jupyter notebook containing a code that I used to train my latest model.
